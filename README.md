# FIFA-Player-Ratings-Prediction

## Project Overview:
This project provides an extensive analysis of the FIFA 19 dataset, focusing on player attributes, club performance, and game statistics. The main goal is to extract insights into player performance metrics, transfer values, and factors affecting player ratings. The analysis combines advanced data manipulation techniques, statistical testing, and machine learning models to uncover key patterns and make predictions.

## Research Questions:
1) What are the primary attributes that affect player ratings in FIFA 19?
2) How can a player's transfer value be predicted based on their attributes?
3) Are there notable differences in player attributes across various positions or leagues?
4) Which factors are most predictive of a player's overall rating?

## Tools and Technologies:
**Programming Languages:** Python, R
**Data Manipulation:** pandas, numpy
**Data Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, Tableau
**Machine Learning:** sklearn, xgboost
**Statistical Analysis:** scipy, statsmodels
**Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA

## Methodology:
The project utilizes a range of techniques to analyze the dataset:

**Data Cleaning:**  Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries using pandas and custom preprocessing scripts.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used seaborn and matplotlib for visual exploration of data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
**Feature Engineering:** Created new features from player attributes and performance metrics to improve model accuracy.
**Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Employed PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify principal components influencing player ratings.
**Regression Models:** Applied linear and polynomial regression models to predict player transfer values and ratings.
**Machine Learning Models:** Utilized decision trees and XGBoost for classification tasks and feature importance analysis.

## Results and Insights:
The analysis provided several key insights:

**Key Influencers:** Identified important attributes affecting player ratings, such as position, skill attributes, and age.

**Predictive Modeling:** Developed highly accurate models for predicting player transfer values and ratings, illustrating the impact of various attributes.

**Position and League Analysis:** Found significant differences in attributes across positions and leagues that affect overall performance metrics.

**Principal Components:** PCA identified critical features contributing most to player ratings, facilitating future analyses.
